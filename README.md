# HWL Engine
Simple and inefficient Ray Casting Engine written in C using Allegro 5 Library, designed to run a simple horror-like game. Made as a school project.
I think the end result turned out pretty cool, considering how busy we were with other school stuff, and what short amount of time we've had.
